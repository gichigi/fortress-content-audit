# AI Style Guide Generator - Project Scratchpad

## 📋 Project Overview
Web app that generates brand style guides from website URLs using AI to extract and analyze brand elements. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI API, and Stripe.

## 🎯 Core User Journey
1. **Landing Page** → Enter website URL or create manually
2. **Website Analysis** → AI extracts brand info and autofills form
3. **Brand Details** → User reviews/edits brand information  
4. **Preview** → Shows partial style guide with paywall
5. **Payment** → Stripe checkout for full access
6. **Email Capture** → Collects email for thank you & abandoned cart recovery
7. **Full Access** → Complete style guide with download options

## 🚧 Active Tasks

Note on terminology: "Clear" means remove the task from Active Tasks, add a short summary under Completed, and record any key lessons learned.

### High Priority (P0)

- Collect usability feedback on new Keywords tag UI (Foundation variant) and adjust spacing/contrast as needed
- Evaluate impact of passing keywords to prompts; if weak, enable Task 3 variants (lexicon linking, required usage)

### Medium Priority (P1)
- **Benefit**: More complete and useful style guides that include brand context alongside voice guidelines



### Low Priority (P2)

**🏷️ Fix Preview Page Title Display**
- **Issue**: Preview page still shows "Core Style Guide" instead of "Preview Style Guide" at the top
- **Root Cause**: Title likely coming from template content, not the React component we updated
- **Location**: May be in template markdown or different component than expected
- **Impact**: User confusion - contradicts transparency goals

**📧 Test & Debug Abandoned Cart Email System**
- **Issue**: Automated abandoned cart emails may not be working in production
- **Current State**: System deployed with hourly cron, admin client, and proper environment variables
- **Need To Check**: Vercel cron logs, email processing logs, database status after 2+ hours
- **Testing**: Create test email capture, wait 2+ hours, verify automated email delivery
- **Debug**: Check if cron job actually runs, if database queries work, if emails send

**Investigate Complete Guide Generation Performance**
- **Observation**: Complete guides make 2 sequential OpenAI calls (voice traits + style rules)
- **Impact**: Takes 60-90 seconds total, contributing to timeout issues
- **Consider**: Parallel generation or caching to reduce time
- **Note**: May not be a bug - could be intentional design for complete guides

### Done/Completed

**✅ Latest Session Achievements (Aug 2025)**
- **Task 1 — Pass traits (predefined and custom) into rules prompts**
  - Implemented conditional "Traits Context" in rules prompts.
  - Predefined traits use static `TRAITS`; custom traits use AI-generated descriptions.
  - If traits are missing/fail, omit the section so prompts rely on brand info only.
  - Verified via CLI across formal and casual brands; observed expected tone shifts.
- **Task 2 — Audience summary from extraction + prompt usage**
  - Extraction API now returns `audience` for URL and description paths.
  - Wired audience through homepage/start → brand-details → generation.
  - `renderStyleGuideTemplate` uses audience in prompts; hidden from templates.
  - Verified end-to-end via CLI; output reflects formal/inclusive choices for healthcare.
- **Custom traits prompt enhancement**
  - Custom trait generator now explicitly references the core audience in the one-sentence description and tailors examples to that audience.
  - Expect more lines like “instills confidence in healthcare providers.”
- **Preview Page Overhaul**: Dynamic brand voice generation with 50%+ performance improvement (8s → 3-4s)
- **Abandoned Cart Automation**: Fully automated hourly email scheduler with Vercel cron and admin Supabase client
- **Webhook System Fixed**: Stripe signature validation now working - payment processing and email delivery functional
- **Email Capture Optimization**: Changed from onChange to onBlur - 95% fewer API calls and better data quality
- **Performance Optimization**: Parallel processing for custom traits using Promise.all() vs sequential calls
- **Security Enhancement**: Moved AI generation from client-side to server-side API endpoints
- **Mobile Homepage UX**: Responsive input layout, optimized icon sizing, and "Try it out" CTA for better mobile experience
- **Brand Description in Style Guides**: Added "About [Brand]" section to all templates with AI-extracted brand context and audience info

**✅ Major System Components (Jan 2025)**
- **Payment & Generation Pipeline**: Fixed race conditions, hardcoded values, and timeout issues for $149 complete guides
- **Email Systems**: Complete abandoned cart recovery with session linking, webhook integration, and automated processing
- **Dynamic Content**: Homepage URL/description processing, preview generation, and template processing working end-to-end
- **User Experience**: Mobile-first design, loading states, error handling, and payment success flows optimized

## 📚 Key Lessons Learned

### Brand Voice & Rules — Key Learnings (Task 1)
- **Audience at crawl-time > post-form**: Generating audience from crawled content yields higher-quality guidance and better grounding vs. generating it later from trimmed brand details.
- **Audience-aware custom traits**: Prompting custom trait generation to reference audience improves specificity and perceived intentionality.

- **Traits subtly steer rules**: Passing full trait descriptions nudges choices (e.g., contractions, pronouns, date formats) in the expected direction for both formal and casual brands.
- **Custom traits add specificity**: AI-generated custom traits (e.g., "Technical", "Conversational") produce clearer, brand-fitting guidance than predefined-only.
- **Predefined traits are static**: Good baseline but generic; plan to tailor via AI rewrite (Task 3) for brand fit.
- **Model infers from brand context**: Even without traits, rules are reasonable; trait context strengthens intent rather than fully changing direction.
- **Conditional traits context is safer**: If trait gen fails, we omit the section; prompts fall back to brand info—no invented traits.
- **User-perceived intent depends on content**: Domain terms + brand lexicon and rules that explicitly reference tone/traits (e.g., "Use contractions to reinforce your casual, conversational voice") best demonstrate intentionality.
- **Control gaps identified**: Formality and reading level not yet enforced by prompts—causes mixed contractions/pronouns in some cases; wiring (Task 2b) will fix.
- **Token efficiency**: Trimming trait context (~4k chars) keeps calls stable while preserving signal.

### Technical Architecture
- **Markdown rendering complexity** - `react-markdown` provides safer, more consistent rendering than `marked` + dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- **Plugin ecosystem** - `remark-breaks` solved line break issues more robustly than custom formatting functions
- **Template consistency is critical** - Always use shared components for uniform styling across all generated content
- **Type safety prevents runtime errors** - Add type guards before accessing AI responses

### User Experience  
- **Mobile-first + loading states** - Most users access on mobile, always provide feedback instead of blank screens
- **Payment UX strategy** - Static previews save OpenAI costs, full generation only post-payment
- **Error handling matters** - Generic errors cause user dropoff, need specific helpful messages

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI responses need validation** - Always check format, handle edge cases, use chunked generation
- **Cost optimization matters** - GPT-3.5 for extraction, GPT-4 for generation, 10k character limits
- **Model fallbacks** - Having backup models prevents complete failures
- **Parallel processing wins** - Promise.all() for multiple AI calls reduces latency by 50%+ vs sequential
- **Client-side AI is dangerous** - Always use server-side endpoints to protect API keys and ensure reliability

### Development Process
- **Incremental implementation** - Break complex changes into phases for testing and validation
- **Visual proof testing** - Side-by-side comparisons on test pages catch issues early
- **Data flow validation** - Test through all system layers before marking complete
- **T-shirt sizing works** - SMALL (30 min), MEDIUM (1-2 hours), LARGE (half day+) for realistic estimates
- **Test CLI first, then UI** - Faster feedback loop for API issues, easier debugging
- **Clean as you go** - Move completed tasks immediately to keep scratchpad focused

### Email & Automation Systems
- **Email capture timing** - onBlur vs onChange makes huge difference in data quality and API efficiency
- **Admin vs anon clients** - Use service role keys for automated operations, anon keys for user-facing features
- **Webhook secret management** - Different secrets for CLI vs dashboard vs production - match environment correctly
- **Automation scheduling** - Vercel Pro cron jobs work great for hourly tasks, require proper environment setup
- **Database permissions** - RLS policies block automation - service role bypasses for reliable background jobs

### React State & Race Conditions
- **Race Condition Pattern**: `setState()` is async - don't call functions immediately after that depend on the new state value. React batches state updates for performance, so the new value isn't available instantly
- **Race Condition Fix**: Pass values directly to functions instead of relying on state that may not be updated yet. E.g., `generateStyleGuide(paramValue)` instead of `setState(paramValue); generateStyleGuide()`
- **Debug Pattern**: When UI shows one thing but backend processes another, check for async state issues and parameter passing mismatches between frontend and API
- **React State Timing**: State updates don't happen immediately - they're queued and processed later in the React lifecycle

### Error Handling & Validation
- **Frontend validation > backend validation** - Better UX to block submission early vs show errors after
- **Context-specific error types** - Payment success page only needs 9 of 16 total error types
- **Smart retry > page reload** - 3x faster, preserves state, better analytics
- **Pre-filled support emails** - Include error context and timestamps for better support experience
- **Consistent error UX** - Same patterns across all pages build user confidence

### Project Management
- **1-line summaries > detailed histories** - Keep completed work concise and scannable
- **Break large tasks into small testable pieces** - Each step should have clear completion criteria
- **Visual feedback guides behavior** - Colors, disabled states help users understand what to do next
- **Fix at source > downstream processing** - Remove duplicate content from templates rather than filtering it later
