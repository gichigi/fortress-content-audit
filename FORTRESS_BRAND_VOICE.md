# Fortress Brand Voice Guidelines

**Core Message:** Brand voice is the moat.

---

## Overview

Fortress helps copywriters, agencies, and founders build unbreachable brand voices. Our voice must reflect the same precision, confidence, and craft we help others achieve.

**Audience:** Copywriters, agency founders, startup builders (28-45, urban, UK/US/CA/AUS, leaning male). They value craft, precision, and tools that feel professional but not stuffy.

---

## Core Traits

### 1. Authoritative
We speak with confidence because we understand brand voice deeply. We don't hedge or apologize. We state what works and why.

**What It Means:**
→ Use declarative statements, not questions
→ Present insights as facts backed by expertise
→ Avoid "we think" or "you might want to consider"
→ Lead with conviction, support with clarity

**What It Doesn't Mean:**
✗ Being condescending or dismissive of other approaches
✗ Using jargon to sound smart
✗ Making claims we can't back up

### 2. Precise
Every word earns its place. We edit ruthlessly. Our copy is tight, clear, and purposeful.

**What It Means:**
→ Cut unnecessary words and phrases
→ Use specific terms over vague ones
→ Structure sentences for maximum clarity
→ One strong point per sentence

**What It Doesn't Mean:**
✗ Sacrificing clarity for brevity
✗ Using obscure vocabulary
✗ Removing helpful context or examples

### 3. Reassuring
We understand the weight of brand voice decisions. Our tone is steady, reliable, and confident—like a well-built fortress with a solid foundation.

**What It Means:**
→ Acknowledge the complexity without overwhelming
→ Provide clear paths forward (build bridges, not walls)
→ Use "you can" and "here's how" over "you should"
→ Show, don't just tell

**What It Doesn't Mean:**
✗ Being overly casual or dismissive of concerns
✗ Making everything sound easy when it's not
✗ Using excessive enthusiasm or exclamation points

### 4. Craft-Focused
We respect the work. We speak to practitioners who care about the details.

**What It Means:**
→ Reference the craft of writing and brand building
→ Acknowledge nuance and trade-offs
→ Use industry-appropriate terminology when helpful
→ Show we understand their world

**What It Doesn't Mean:**
✗ Using insider jargon that excludes newcomers
✗ Over-explaining basics to experienced users
✗ Being pretentious about the work

## Tone Guidelines

### Formality Level: Professional
- Avoid contractions in formal communications (emails, documentation)
- Allow contractions in UI copy and conversational contexts
- Use third person when describing features ("Fortress generates" not "We generate")

### Reading Level: 12-14
- Write for professionals who read widely
- Technical precision is welcome when accurate
- Complex ideas are fine; complex sentences are not

### English Variant: Flexible (US/UK/CA/AUS)
- Default to US spelling and punctuation
- Accept UK variants in user-generated content
- Be consistent within each document

## Voice Examples

### ✅ Good: Authoritative and Precise
"Brand voice is your competitive moat. When competitors can't replicate your tone, you've built something defensible."

### ❌ Bad: Hedging and Vague
"We think brand voice might be important for some businesses, and you might want to consider it as part of your strategy."

---

### ✅ Good: Reassuring and Clear
"Building a brand voice takes time, but Fortress gives you the foundation. Start with your homepage content, and we'll identify patterns you can codify. The structure becomes clear once you see what you've already built."

### ❌ Bad: Overly Enthusiastic
"Transform your brand voice in minutes! It's super easy and fun! 🎉"

---

### ✅ Good: Craft-Focused
"Your brand voice guidelines should reflect how you actually write, not how you think you write. That's why we analyze your existing content first."

### ❌ Bad: Condescending
"Most brands don't understand voice, but we do. Let us fix your mess."

---

## Word Choice

### Preferred Terms
- **Brand voice** (not "tone of voice" or "brand personality")
- **Guidelines** (not "rules" or "standards") - the structure that supports your voice
- **Audit** (not "analysis" or "review") - inspection of your content
- **Generate** (not "create" or "build")
- **Foundation** (core traits, base principles)
- **Structure** (how content is organized)
- **Outpost** (free plan) and **Watchtower** (pro plan)
- **Sentry** (future: regular scanning for inconsistencies)
- **Bridge** (future: improving accessibility and connections)

### Avoid
- Marketing buzzwords: "innovative," "cutting-edge," "revolutionary"
- Overused phrases: "game-changer," "next-level," "world-class"
- Excessive modifiers: "incredibly," "extremely," "absolutely"

---

## Structural Guidelines

### Headlines
- Lead with the benefit or insight
- Use active voice
- Keep under 60 characters when possible
- Example: "Brand voice is the moat" not "Why brand voice matters"
- Subtle wordplay is welcome when it reinforces the message: "Build your foundation" works; "Castle in the sky" doesn't

### Body Copy
- One idea per paragraph
- Lead with the most important point
- Use examples to illustrate, not just explain
- Break up long blocks with whitespace or lists
- Structure your arguments like building walls: each paragraph supports the foundation

### CTAs
- Action-oriented verbs: "Start," "Generate," "Audit," "Upgrade"
- Clear value: "Generate your guidelines" not "Get started"
- Match the user's context: "Save for later" when they're mid-flow
- Subtle wordplay in CTAs is fine if it clarifies: "Build your foundation" is better than "Get started"

---

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Landing Page
- Headline: One clear value proposition
- Subheadline: One sentence that expands the headline
- CTA: Single, clear action
- No feature lists, no testimonials, no pricing tables (unless essential)

### Product UI
- Labels are descriptive; subtle wordplay is welcome when it adds clarity
- Error messages explain what happened and how to fix it
- Success states confirm the action clearly
- Loading states set expectations ("Analyzing your content..." or "Building your foundation...")
- Feature names can use fortress themes: Sentry (scans for issues), Bridge (improves accessibility), Watchtower (oversight)

### Documentation
- Start with the outcome, then the steps
- Use code blocks and examples liberally
- Assume competence but provide context
- Cross-reference related concepts

### Emails
- Subject lines: Benefit or action; subtle wordplay is fine if it reinforces the message
- Body: Get to the point in the first sentence
- Sign-off: Professional but human ("Best," "Thanks,")
- Example: "Your foundation is ready" works; "Knock knock, who's there?" doesn't

---

## The Fortress Metaphor (Subtle Use)

**When to use:**
- Plan names: Outpost, Watchtower
- Feature names: "Audit" (inspection), "Guidelines" (structure), "Sentry" (regular scanning), "Bridge" (accessibility)
- Structural terms: "foundation" (core principles), "structure" (organization), "walls" (boundaries), "gate" (entry points)
- Occasional references: "defensible," "foundation," "structure," "build," "fortify," "reinforce"
- Wordplay that reinforces meaning: "Build your foundation" (both literal and metaphorical)

**When not to use:**
- Literal castle imagery or medieval language
- Over-extended metaphors that confuse the message
- Gimmicky references that distract from the message
- Wordplay for its own sake (it must serve clarity)

**Good wordplay examples:**
- ✅ "Build your foundation" (clear action + metaphor)
- ✅ "Your voice structure is ready" (descriptive + thematic)
- ✅ "Sentry found 5 inconsistencies" (feature name + clear meaning)
- ✅ "Bridge the gap in your guidelines" (feature name + actionable)

**Bad wordplay examples:**
- ❌ "Ye olde brand voice" (gimmicky, medieval)
- ❌ "Drawbridge your way to better copy" (forced, unclear)
- ❌ "Hark! Your guidelines await" (too on-the-nose)

## Common Patterns

### Explaining Value
**Pattern:** Problem → Solution → Outcome
"Most brands struggle with inconsistent voice. Fortress analyzes your content and generates guidelines that codify your actual style. Result: your team writes with confidence and your voice becomes defensible."

### Describing Features
**Pattern:** What it does → Why it matters
"Content audit identifies inconsistencies across your site. This shows you where your voice breaks down, so you know what to fix. Sentry will scan regularly to catch drift before it becomes a problem."

### Addressing Concerns
**Pattern:** Acknowledge → Reframe → Reassure
"Building brand voice guidelines can feel overwhelming. That's why we start with what you've already written. You're closer than you think—your foundation is already there, we just help you see the structure."

---

## What We Don't Do

- We don't oversell or use hyperbole
- We don't make everything sound easy
- We don't use emojis in professional communications
- We don't apologize for being a paid tool
- We don't compare ourselves to competitors by name
- We don't use "we" when "Fortress" is clearer
- We don't use wordplay that obscures meaning (clarity always wins)
- We don't force fortress metaphors where they don't fit naturally

---

## Testing Your Copy

Before publishing, ask:
1. Does this sound like something a copywriter would respect?
2. Is every word necessary?
3. Would I trust this if I were evaluating the tool?
4. Does it reflect the "brand voice is the moat" philosophy?
5. Is the fortress theme subtle, not gimmicky?
6. If there's wordplay, does it reinforce meaning or distract from it?

If yes to all, ship it.

**Wordplay test:** If you can remove the wordplay and the message is clearer, remove it. If the wordplay makes the message more memorable or actionable, keep it.
