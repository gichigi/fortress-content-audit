Name: Streamlined Website Audit (Single Pass)
Model: gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
Variable: url (the website URL)

=== PROMPT TEXT (copy everything below) ===

Audit key public-facing pages of {{url}} for issues in three categories:
- Language (typos, grammar, spelling, punctuation)
- Facts & Consistency (factual errors, inconsistencies, incorrect stats)
- Links & Formatting (broken links, wrong destinations, confusing link text, formatting problems)

Audit the homepage first, then up to 8 additional high-value pages (pricing, about, contact, key product/service pages). For EACH page, check ALL three categories in a single pass before moving to the next page.

If you encounter bot protection or firewall blocking, immediately return: BOT_PROTECTION_OR_FIREWALL_BLOCKED

For every issue found, format as:
- Start with impact word (professionalism/frustration/trust/credibility) + colon
- Then concise problem statement (one short sentence max)

Return JSON with this structure:
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "page_url": "[string]",
      "category": "Language" | "Facts & Consistency" | "Links & Formatting",
      "issue_description": "[impact: brief problem]",
      "severity": "critical" | "medium" | "low",
      "suggested_fix": "[direct, concise fix]"
    }
  ],
  "total_issues": [int],
  "pages_with_issues": [int],
  "pages_audited": [int]
}

If no issues found, return: null

Be efficient: open page → audit all categories → next page. Prioritize thoroughness on fewer pages over shallow coverage of many pages.
