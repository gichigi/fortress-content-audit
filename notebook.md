- remove transformer when implementing test

--
**Testing notes**


## Homepage
[Your Audit Results] = [URL Audit Results]
Remove toolbar [search issues, all issues dropdown, Customise columns], remove 3 dots options to resolve/ignore
Make "view all x issues" more of a primary CTA
Add Health score and card components 
After ignoring issue on homepage, table unresponsive
side slider when clicking issue name unnecessary
Transition back to / gracefully with fade in like the fade out to interstitial

## auth
users should be able to sign in with password too – explore the best UX for this
footer shouldn't have to exist, useres should be automatically reidrected to their dash if they're authed

## Dashboard page
instead of each list item being a group, each item should be an instance and find another way to group (maybe column with badge)
Guides tab not needed
error not using alert or toast, Nextjs error
add status column aligned with status
- auto run in place of run audit
- if firewall return msg to user



## settings
Nowhere to be found

## pricing
will be rewritten
