**Testing notes**

## Dashboard page
- on first audit, user currently sees chart with single marker, which is correct since there's no prev audit but to make more compelling, user should see two data points; the one they just did and the day before (100/100) so that it looks like they've gotten worse and so that they can see the chart in action. Makes them want to get the marker back up to 100. 
- Raise the bar for "excellent quality" content to 95+/100 and raise the others accordingly. Currently it says good when its 65/100 which isn't good it's ok
- simplify and tidy new domain pop up
- model verbosity too high especially for issue, impact fields. layout for expanded issues needs refactoring, spans entire width of page
